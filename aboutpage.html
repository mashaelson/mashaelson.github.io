<center><p> Hi everybody! </p>
This is a website that I whipped up to be able to practice my HTML and CSS. I've added a portfolio with some of my photography work as well.

<h2>About Me</h2>
As a super quick about me, my name is Masha and I currently attend California State University Chico. So far, I am having a fantastic time at university! During the summer of 2019, I participated in Google CSSI-Extension at Chico and was able to develop my coding skills. In my free time, I enjoy art, hiking, music, photography, and spending time with others.

<center><p> Hi everybody! </p>
This is a website that I whipped up to be able to practice my HTML and CSS. I've added a portfolio with some of my photography work as well. I'm hoping to eventually expand on this site.

<h2>About Me</h2>
Hi everyone, my name is Masha and I currently attend California State University Chico. I am declared as a Biological Sciences major and I'm excited to see where my education takes me. During the summer of 2019, I participated in Google CSSI-Extension at Chico and was able to develop my coding skills. On a personal note, I enjoy painting. I also enjoy fishing and hiking when I get the chance.</center>
